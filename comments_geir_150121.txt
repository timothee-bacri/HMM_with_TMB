# comments Geir:

- Use the function $g$ and explain why it is particularly nice with TMB to get SD based on a hessian matrix (Use the formula etc.)
- make a paragraph about changing the conditional distribution
- In section 4.1 we can also motivate why we have not made an R-package
- make "norm_hmm.cpp, exp_hmm.cpp, binom_hmm.cpp, 
- Structure the github repo by section.
- Timothy: Add install.packages(TMB) in section 2.2 (use eval = F and so on). 
- Timothy: Make sure that the R-file that goes into GitHub is in sync with the document. 
- Timothy: One-state models are not HMMs. Do not put in gitub 
- Timothy: After Jan corrects section 4.3, the part on inconsistency of delta can be moved to the readme file of section 4.
