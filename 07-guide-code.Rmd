# GitHub directory structure
For an easier reading, we recommend opening the file `hmm-tmb.Rproj` with R-Studio.
Most of the code can be folded/collapsed into sections easily by clicking in the menu `Edit`->`Collapse All Output`.
Unfolding can be done by clicking on the arrows to the left of the folded sections, or in the menu `Edit`->`Expand All Output`.

## Folder `code`
The file `main.R` is used to run the procedures related to timing and comparisons presented in the article.

The first chunk of code it runs can be found in the file `setup_parameters.R` in the same folder.
Its role is to set up multiple variables, either to define some global constants or to store useful results for easier maintenance.

The following chunks of code are `poi_hmm_tinn.R`, `poi_hmm_lamb.R`, `poi_hmm_simu1.R`, and `poi_hmm_simu2.R`.
Most of their code is common.\

`Parameters and covariates` defines parameters and covariates in natural form. The simulation files generate data there.\
`Parameters & covariates for TMB` transforms parameters and covariates to their working form.\
`Estimation` computes estimates with and without TMB for further comparison.\
`Store negative log-likelihoods`

**Randomness**: A unique randomness seed is set in each of these four files before all time-consuming tasks which involve some randomness.
`setup_parameters.R` defines the random number generator's version.

## Folder `data`
`main.R` stores important results in this folder
