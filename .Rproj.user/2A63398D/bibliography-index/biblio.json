            "abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a useful tool for capturing the behavior of overdispersed, autocorrelated data. These models have been applied to many different problems, including speech recognition, precipitation modeling, and gene finding and profiling. Typically, HMMs are applied to individual stochastic processes; HMMs for simultaneously modeling multiple processesas in the longitudinal data settinghave not been widely studied. In this article I present a new class of models, mixed HMMs (MHMMs), where I use both covariates and random effects to capture differences among processes. I define the models using the framework of generalized linear mixed models and discuss their interpretation. I then provide algorithms for parameter estimation and illustrate the properties of the estimators via a simulation study. Finally, to demonstrate the practical uses of MHMMs, I provide an application to data on lesion counts in multiple sclerosis patients. I show that my model, while parsimonious, can describe the heterogeneity among such patients.",

We propose a hybrid algorithm that is designed to combine the advantageous features of the two algorithms and compare the performance of the three algorithms using simulated data from a designed experiment, and a real data set. The properties investigated are speed of convergence, stability, dependence on initial values, different parameterizations. We also describe the results of an experiment to assess the true coverage probability of bootstrap-based confidence intervals for the parameters.",

            "abstract": "Hidden Markov models have become a widely used class of statistical models with applications in diverse areas such as communications engineering, bioinformatics, finance and many more. This book is a comprehensive treatment of inference for hidden Markov models, including both algorithms and statistical theory. Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states. In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces, which allow for exact algorithms for filtering, estimation etc. and models with continuous state spaces (also called state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in detail. Simulation in hidden Markov models is addressed in five different chapters that cover both Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Many examples illustrate the algorithms and theory. The book also carefully treats Gaussian linear state-space models and their extensions and it contains a chapter on general Markov chain theory and probabilistic aspects of hidden Markov models. This volume will suit anybody with an interest in inference for stochastic processes, and it will be useful for researchers and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The algorithmic parts of the book do not require an advanced mathematical background, while the more theoretical parts require knowledge of probability theory at the measure-theoretical level. From the reviews: \"By providing an overall survey of results obtained so far in a very readable manner, and also presenting some new ideas, this well-written book will appeal to academic researchers in the field of HMMs, with PhD students working on related topics included. It will also appeal to practitioners and researchers from other fields by guiding them through the computational steps needed for making inference HMMs and/or by providing them with the relevant underlying statistical theory. In the reviewer’s opinion this book will shortly become a reference work in its field.\" MathSciNet \"This monograph is a valuable resource. It provides a good literature review, an excellent account of the state of the art research on the necessary theory and algorithms, and ample illustrations of numerous applications of HMM. It goes much beyond the earlier resources on HMM...I anticipate this work to serve well many Technometrics readers in the coming years.\" Haikady N. Nagaraja for Technometrics, November 2006",

It can also be used in a way that stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory, being more concerned with understanding basic statistical concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal optimality investigations.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.",

            "abstract": "The problem of estimating the number of hidden states in a hidden Markov model is considered. Emphasis is placed on cross-validated likelihood criteria. Using cross-validation to assess the number of hidden states allows to circumvent the well-documented technical difficulties of the order identification problem in mixture models. Moreover, in a predictive perspective, it does not require that the sampling distribution belongs to one of the models in competition. However, computing cross-validated likelihood for hidden Markov models for which only one training sample is available, involves difficulties since the data are not independent. Two approaches are proposed to compute cross-validated likelihood for a hidden Markov model. The first one consists of using a deterministic half-sampling procedure, and the second one consists of an adaptation of the EM algorithm for hidden Markov models, to take into account randomly missing values induced by cross-validation. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets compare different versions of cross-validated likelihood criterion and penalised likelihood criteria, including BIC and a penalised marginal likelihood criterion. Those numerical experiments highlight a promising behaviour of the deterministic half-sampling criterion.",

Such singular models do not obey the regularity conditions underlying the derivation of Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the penalty structure in BIC generally does not reflect the frequentist large-sample behavior of their marginal likelihood. While large-sample theory for the marginal likelihood of singular models has been developed recently, the resulting approximations depend on the true parameter value and lead to a paradox of circular reasoning. Guided by examples such as determining the number of components of mixture models, the number of factors in latent factor models or the rank in reduced-rank regression, we propose a resolution to this paradox and give a practical extension of BIC for singular model selection problems.",

Examination of such recordings suggests that the current is quantal in nature, alternating in a seemingly random manner between \"on\" and \"off,\" but the recordings are corrupted by noise from a variety of sources. In this paper we propose and illustrate methods for restoring the underlying quantal signal from such noisy measurements. The methods use a Markov chain prior distribution for the underlying quantal process and base the restoration on the resulting posterior distribution.]",

It includes various topics which are suitable for undergraduate courses, but are not routinely taught. It is suitable to the beginner, and provides a taste and encouragement for more advanced work. There are four main aims: 1) to provide a thorough but straightforward account of basic probability, giving the reader a natural feel for the subject unburdened by oppressive technicalities, 2) to discuss important random processes in depth with many examples. 3) to cover a range of important but less routine topics, 4) to impart to the beginner the flavour of more advanced work. The books begins with basic ideas common to many undergraduate courses in mathematics, statistics and the sciences; in concludes with topics usually found at graduate level. The ordering and numbering of material in this third edition has been mostly preserved from the second. Minor alterations and additions have been added for clearer exposition. Highlights include new sections on sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo, geometric probability, coupling and Poisson approximation, large deviations, spatial Poisson processes, renewal-reward, queueing networks, stochastic calculus, Itô’s formula and option pricing in the Black-Scholes model for financial markets. In addition there are many (nearly 400) new exercises and problems that are entertaining and instructive; their solutions can be found in the companion volume ’One Thousand Exercises in Probability’, (OUP 2001).",

            "abstract": "The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one’s data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time-series data when one does not have a finite-dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first-order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time-series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems. Résumé Le bootstrap est une méthode pour estimer la distribution d’un estimateur en rééchantillonnant ses données ou un modéle estiméà partir des données. Les méthodes disponibles pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap et la précision des estimateurs de bootstrap dépendent de ce que les données proviennent d’un échantillon aléatoire indépendant ou d’une série temporelle. Cet article concerne l’application du bootstrap aux données des séries temporelles quand on ne dispose pas de modéle paramétrique de dimension finie qui réduise le processus de génération des données à l’échantillonnage aléatoire indépendent. Nous examinons les méthodes qui ont été proposées pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap dans cette situation et discutons la precision de ces méthodes comparativement à celle des approximations asymptotiques de premier ordre. Nous montrons que les méthodes pour mettre en oeuvre le bootstrap avec les données des séries temporelles ne sont pas aussi bien comprises que les méthodes pour les données des échantillons aléatoires indépendants. Bien que des méthodes de bootstrap prometteuses pour les séries temporelles soient disponibles, il y a un besoin considérable de recherche supplémental re dans leur application. Nous décrivons quelques problémes importants non résolus.",

            "abstract": "We consider two-stage models of the kind used in parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) methodology, calling them conditionally independent hierarchical models. We suppose that there are k “units,” which may be experimental subjects, cities, study centers, etcetera. At the first stage, the observation vectors Yi for units i = 1, …, k are independently distributed with densities p(yi | i ), or more generally, p(yi | i, \\lambda). At the second stage, the unit-specific parameter vectors i are iid with densities p(i | \\lambda). The PEB approach proceeds by regarding the second-stage distribution as a prior and noting that, if \\lambda were known, inference about  could be based on its posterior. Since \\lambda is not known, the simplest PEB methods estimate the parameter \\lambda by maximum likelihood or some variant, and then treat \\lambda as if it were known to be equal to this estimate. Although this procedure is sometimes satisfactory, a well-known defect is that it neglects the uncertainty due to the estimation of \\lambda. In this article we suggest that approximate Bayesian inference can provide simple and manageable solutions to this problem. In Bayesian inferences, a prior density \\pi(\\cdot) on \\lambda is introduced, the posterior p(\\lambda | y) is calculated, and the posterior density of i is then equal to the expectation, with respect to p(\\lambda | y), of the conditional posterior p(i | yi, \\lambda). From the Bayesian point of view, the PEB estimate is of interest because it is a first-order approximation to the posterior mean [having an error of order O(k -1)]. Letting E\\lambda and V\\lambda denote the expectation and variance with respect to p(\\lambda | y), we may write the posterior variance of i as V(i | y) = E\\lambda V(i | yi, \\lambda) + V\\lambda E(i | yi, \\lambda). The conditional posterior variance , where is the maximum likelihood estimator, approximates only the first term. When we include an approximation to the second term we obtain a first-order approximation to the posterior variance itself. In many examples, this elementary method, incorporating approximations to both terms, will substantially account for the estimation of \\lambda. We briefly consider second-order approximations, noting that the work of Deely and Lindley (1981) may be extended using expansions derived by Lindley (1980), Mosteller and Wallace (1964), Tierney and Kadane (1986), and Tierney, Kass, and Kadane (1989). We suggest that second-order approximations provide rough and, often, easily computed assessments of accuracy of first-order approximations. Although we confine our data-analytical examples to simple models, we believe the methods will be useful in general settings. An important area of application is longitudinal data analysis.",

The choice of a theoretical distribution is also difficult when model-expected frequencies are 0 or when model probabilities are estimated 0 or 1. The authors propose to solve these problems by estimating the distribution of a fit measure, using bootstrap methods. An algorithm is presented for estimating this distribution by drawing bootstrap samples from the model-expected proportions, the so-called nonnaive bootstrap method. For the first time the method is applied to empirical data of varying sparseness, from five different data sets. Results show that the asymptotic chi-square distribution is not at all valid for sparse data.",

With an emphasis on the applications of mixture models in both mainstream analysis and other areas such as unsupervised pattern recognition, speech recognition, and medical imaging, the book describes the formulations of the finite mixture approach, details its methodology, discusses aspects of its implementation, and illustrates its application in many common statistical contexts. Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: * Provides more than 800 references-40% published since 1995 * Includes an appendix listing available mixture software * Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature * Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.",

The likelihood function and likelihood ratios have clear intuitive meanings that make it easy for students to grasp the important concepts. Modern computing technology has made it possible to use these methods over a wide range of practical applications. However, many mathematical statistics textbooks, particularly those at the Senior/Masters level, do not give this important topic coverage commensurate with its place in the world of modern applications. Similarly, in nonlinear estimation problems, standard practice (as reflected by procedures available in the popular commercial statistical packages) has been slow to recognize the advantages of likelihood-based confidence regions/intervals over the commonly use “normal-theory” regions/intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of the “Wald statistic.” In this note we outline our approach for presenting, to students, confidence regions/intervals based on ML estimation.",

The present study investigated emotion dynamics in N = 306 users of the “TrackYourTinnitus” application who completed the Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ) at one assessment point and provided complete data on at least five assessment points for the following state variables: tinnitus loudness, tinnitus distress, arousal, valence. The repeated arousal and valence ratings were used for two operationalizations of emotion dynamics: intra-individual variability of affect intensity (pulse) as well as intra-individual variability of affect quality (spin). Pearson correlation coefficients showed that the Mini-TQ was positively correlated with pulse (r = 0.19; p < 0.05) as well as with spin (r = 0.12; p < 0.05). Multilevel models revealed the following results: increases in tinnitus loudness were more strongly associated with increases in tinnitus distress at higher levels of pulse as well as at higher levels of spin (both p < 0.05), whereby increases in tinnitus loudness correlated even stronger with increases in tinnitus distress when both pulse as well as spin were high (p < 0.05). Moreover, increases in spin were associated with a less favorable time course of tinnitus loudness (p < 0.05). To conclude, equilibrating emotion dynamics might be a potential target in the prevention and treatment of tinnitus.",

            "abstract": "Many highly prevalent diseases (e.g., tinnitus, migraine, chronic pain) are difficult to treat and universally effective treatments are missing. Available treatments are only effective in patient subgroups, i.e., medical doctors and patients have to figure out which therapy might be helpful in the patient’s situation. Sufficiently large and qualitative longitudinal data sets, however, would be desirable to facilitate evidence-based treatment decisions for individual patients. On one hand, traditional sensing techniques (i.e., clinical trials) have many merits enabling evidence-based medicine. On the other, they have inherent limitations. First, clinical trials are very cost- and labour-intensive. Second, the traditional approach aims at reducing ecological heterogeneity to enable the investigation of homogeneous subsamples. Recently, a new paradigm emerged that offers promising perspectives for collecting large amounts of longitudinal patient data  Mobile Crowd Sensing. By utilizing smart mobile devices of a large number of patients, health information can be gathered from large patient collections as well as at many different time points and in various real life environmental situations. In the Track Your Tinnitus project, we implemented such a mobile crowd sensing platform to reveal new medical aspects about tinnitus with a particular focus on the variability of tinnitus over time depending on the environmental situation. In this paper, the current project status as well as first lessons learned from running the mobile application for twelve months are presented. In turn, the lessons learned are discussed in the context of the new perspectives offered by mobile crowd sensing in the medical field.",

            "abstract": "Tinnitus, the phantom sensation of sound, is a highly prevalent disorder that is difficult to treat, i.e., Available treatments are only effective for patient subgroups. Sufficiently large and qualitative longitudinal data sets, which aggregate the individuals’ demographic and clinical characteristics, together with their response to specific therapeutic interventions, would therefore facilitate evidence-based treatment suggestions for individual patients. Currently, clinical trials are the standard instrument for realizing evidence-based medicine. However, the related information gathering is limited. For example, clinical trials try to reduce the complexity of the individual case by generating homogeneous groups to obtain significant results. From the latter, individual treatment decisions are inferred. A complementary approach would be to assess the effect of specific interventions in large samples considering the individual peculiarity of each subject. This allows providing individualized treatment decisions. Recently, mobile crowd sensing emerged as an approach for collecting large and ecological valid datasets at rather low costs. By providing mobile crowd sensing services to large numbers of patients, large datasets can be gathered cheaply on a daily basis. In the TrackYourTinnitus project, we implemented a mobile crowd sensing platform to reveal new medical aspects on tinnitus and its treatment. Additionally, we work on mobile services exploring approaches for understanding tinnitus and for improving its diagnostic and therapeutic management. We present the TrackYourTinnitus platform as well as its goals, architecture and preliminary results. Overall, the platform and its mobile services offer promising perspectives for tinnitus research and treatment.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a generalization of Kimura’s Markov chain model for base substitution at a single nucleotide site. This generalized model incorporates more flexible transition rates and consequently allows irreversible as well as reversible chains. Because the model embodies just the right amount of symmetry, it permits explicit calculation of finite-time transition probabilities and equilibrium distributions. The model also meshes well with maximum likelihood methods for phylogenetic analysis. Quick calculation of likelihoods and their derivatives can be carried out by adapting Baum’s forward and backward algorithms from the theory of hidden Markov chains. Analysis of HIV sequence data illustrates the speed of the algorithms on trees with many contemporary taxa. Analysis of some of Lake’s data on the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus contrasts the reversible and irreversible versions of the model.",

            "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of hidden Markov models by Baum and his co-workers, the method of choice for fitting such models has been maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. In recent years it has been noticed that the gradient and Hessian of the log likelihood of hidden Markov and related models may be calculated in parallel with a filtering process by which the likelihood may be calculated. Various authors have used, or suggested the use of, this idea in order to maximize the likelihood directly, without using the EM algorithm. In this paper we discuss an implementation of such an approach. We have found that a straightforward implementation of Newton’s method sometimes works but is unreliable. A form of the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm appears to provide excellent reliability. Two rather complex examples are given for applying this algorithm to the fitting of hidden Markov models. In the first a better than 6-fold increase in speed over the EM algorithm was achieved. The second example turned out to be problematic (somewhat interestingly) in that the maximum likelihood estimator appears to be inconsistent. Whatever its merit, this estimator is calculated much faster by LevenbergMarquardt than by EM. We also compared the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm, applied to the first example, with a generic numerical maximization procedure. The LevenbergMarquardt algorithm appeared to perform almost three times better than the generic procedure, even when analytic derivatives were provided, and 19 times better when they were not provided.",
