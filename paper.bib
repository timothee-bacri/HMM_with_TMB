  abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a useful tool for capturing the behavior of overdispersed, autocorrelated data. These models have been applied to many different problems, including speech recognition, precipitation modeling, and gene finding and profiling. Typically, HMMs are applied to individual stochastic processes; HMMs for simultaneously modeling multiple processes\textemdash as in the longitudinal data setting\textemdash have not been widely studied. In this article I present a new class of models, mixed HMMs (MHMMs), where I use both covariates and random effects to capture differences among processes. I define the models using the framework of generalized linear mixed models and discuss their interpretation. I then provide algorithms for parameter estimation and illustrate the properties of the estimators via a simulation study. Finally, to demonstrate the practical uses of MHMMs, I provide an application to data on lesion counts in multiple sclerosis patients. I show that my model, while parsimonious, can describe the heterogeneity among such patients.},

We propose a hybrid algorithm that is designed to combine the advantageous features of the two algorithms and compare the performance of the three algorithms using simulated data from a designed experiment, and a real data set. The properties investigated are speed of convergence, stability, dependence on initial values, different parameterizations.

  abstract = {Hidden Markov models have become a widely used class of statistical models with applications in diverse areas such as communications engineering, bioinformatics, finance and many more. This book is a comprehensive treatment of inference for hidden Markov models, including both algorithms and statistical theory. Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states. In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces, which allow for exact algorithms for filtering, estimation etc. and models with continuous state spaces (also called state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in detail. Simulation in hidden Markov models is addressed in five different chapters that cover both Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Many examples illustrate the algorithms and theory. The book also carefully treats Gaussian linear state-space models and their extensions and it contains a chapter on general Markov chain theory and probabilistic aspects of hidden Markov models. This volume will suit anybody with an interest in inference for stochastic processes, and it will be useful for researchers and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The algorithmic parts of the book do not require an advanced mathematical background, while the more theoretical parts require knowledge of probability theory at the measure-theoretical level. From the reviews: "By providing an overall survey of results obtained so far in a very readable manner, and also presenting some new ideas, this well-written book will appeal to academic researchers in the field of HMMs, with PhD students working on related topics included. It will also appeal to practitioners and researchers from other fields by guiding them through the computational steps needed for making inference HMMs and/or by providing them with the relevant underlying statistical theory. In the reviewer's opinion this book will shortly become a reference work in its field." MathSciNet "This monograph is a valuable resource. It provides a good literature review, an excellent account of the state of the art research on the necessary theory and algorithms, and ample illustrations of numerous applications of HMM. It goes much beyond the earlier resources on HMM...I anticipate this work to serve well many Technometrics readers in the coming years." Haikady N. Nagaraja for Technometrics, November 2006},

  abstract = {The problem of estimating the number of hidden states in a hidden Markov model is considered. Emphasis is placed on cross-validated likelihood criteria. Using cross-validation to assess the number of hidden states allows to circumvent the well-documented technical difficulties of the order identification problem in mixture models. Moreover, in a predictive perspective, it does not require that the sampling distribution belongs to one of the models in competition. However, computing cross-validated likelihood for hidden Markov models for which only one training sample is available, involves difficulties since the data are not independent. Two approaches are proposed to compute cross-validated likelihood for a hidden Markov model. The first one consists of using a deterministic half-sampling procedure, and the second one consists of an adaptation of the EM algorithm for hidden Markov models, to take into account randomly missing values induced by cross-validation. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets compare different versions of cross-validated likelihood criterion and penalised likelihood criteria, including BIC and a penalised marginal likelihood criterion. Those numerical experiments highlight a promising behaviour of the deterministic half-sampling criterion.},

Although large sample theory for the marginal likelihood of singular models has been developed recently, the resulting approximations depend on the true parameter value and lead to a paradox of circular reasoning. Guided by examples such as determining the number of components in mixture models, the number of factors in latent factor models or the rank in reduced rank regression, we propose a resolution to this paradox and give a practical extension of BIC for singular model selection problems.},

  abstract = {The prominence of finite mixture modelling is greater than ever. Many important statistical topics like clustering data, outlier treatment, or dealing with unobserved heterogeneity involve finite mixture models in some way or other. The area of potential applications goes beyond simple data analysis and extends to regression analysis and to non-linear time series analysis using Markov switching models. For more than the hundred years since Karl Pearson showed in 1894 how to estimate the five parameters of a mixture of two normal distributions using the method of moments, statistical inference for finite mixture models has been a challenge to everybody who deals with them. In the past ten years, very powerful computational tools emerged for dealing with these models which combine a Bayesian approach with recent Monte simulation techniques based on Markov chains. This book reviews these techniques and covers the most recent advances in the field, among them bridge sampling techniques and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. It is the first time that the Bayesian perspective of finite mixture modelling is systematically presented in book form. It is argued that the Bayesian approach provides much insight in this context and is easily implemented in practice. Although the main focus is on Bayesian inference, the author reviews several frequentist techniques, especially selecting the number of components of a finite mixture model, and discusses some of their shortcomings compared to the Bayesian approach. The aim of this book is to impart the finite mixture and Markov switching approach to statistical modelling to a wide-ranging community. This includes not only statisticians, but also biologists, economists, engineers, financial agents, market researcher, medical researchers or any other frequent user of statistical models. This book should help newcomers to the field to understand how finite mixture and Markov switching models are formulated, what structures they imply on the data, what they could be used for, and how they are estimated. Researchers familiar with the subject also will profit from reading this book. The presentation is rather informal without abandoning mathematical correctness. Previous notions of Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation are useful but not needed.

There are four main aims: 1) to provide a thorough but straightforward account of basic probability, giving the reader a natural feel for the subject unburdened by oppressive technicalities, 2) to discuss important random processes in depth with many examples. 3) to cover a range of important but less routine topics, 4) to impart to the beginner the flavour of more advanced work. The books begins with basic ideas common to many undergraduate courses in mathematics, statistics and the sciences; in concludes with topics usually found at graduate level. The ordering and numbering of material in this third edition has been mostly preserved from the second. Minor alterations and additions have been added for clearer exposition. Highlights include new sections on sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo, geometric probability, coupling and Poisson approximation, large deviations, spatial Poisson processes, renewal-reward, queueing networks, stochastic calculus, It\^o's formula and option pricing in the Black-Scholes model for financial markets.

For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3\% permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

  abstract = {The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. The methods that are available for implementing the bootstrap and the accuracy of bootstrap estimates depend on whether the data are an independent random sample or a time series. This paper is concerned with the application of the bootstrap to time-series data when one does not have a finite-dimensional parametric model that reduces the data generation process to independent random sampling. We review the methods that have been proposed for implementing the bootstrap in this situation and discuss the accuracy of these methods relative to that of first-order asymptotic approximations. We argue that methods for implementing the bootstrap with time-series data are not as well understood as methods for data that are independent random samples. Although promising bootstrap methods for time series are available, there is a considerable need for further research in the application of the bootstrap to time series. We describe some of the important unsolved problems.

  abstract = {We consider two-stage models of the kind used in parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) methodology, calling them conditionally independent hierarchical models. We suppose that there are k ``units,'' which may be experimental subjects, cities, study centers, etcetera. At the first stage, the observation vectors Yi for units i = 1, \ldots, k are independently distributed with densities p(yi | \texttheta i ), or more generally, p(yi | \texttheta i, {$\lambda$}). At the second stage, the unit-specific parameter vectors \texttheta i are iid with densities p(\texttheta i | {$\lambda$}). The PEB approach proceeds by regarding the second-stage distribution as a prior and noting that, if {$\lambda$} were known, inference about \texttheta{} could be based on its posterior. Since {$\lambda$} is not known, the simplest PEB methods estimate the parameter {$\lambda$} by maximum likelihood or some variant, and then treat {$\lambda$} as if it were known to be equal to this estimate. Although this procedure is sometimes satisfactory, a well-known defect is that it neglects the uncertainty due to the estimation of {$\lambda$}. In this article we suggest that approximate Bayesian inference can provide simple and manageable solutions to this problem. In Bayesian inferences, a prior density {$\pi$}({$\cdot$}) on {$\lambda$} is introduced, the posterior p({$\lambda$} | y) is calculated, and the posterior density of \texttheta i is then equal to the expectation, with respect to p({$\lambda$} | y), of the conditional posterior p(\texttheta i | yi, {$\lambda$}). From the Bayesian point of view, the PEB estimate is of interest because it is a first-order approximation to the posterior mean [having an error of order O(k -1)]. Letting E{$\lambda$} and V{$\lambda$} denote the expectation and variance with respect to p({$\lambda$} | y), we may write the posterior variance of \texttheta i as V(\texttheta i | y) = E{$\lambda$} V(\texttheta i | yi, {$\lambda$}) + V{$\lambda$} E(\texttheta i | yi, {$\lambda$}). The conditional posterior variance , where is the maximum likelihood estimator, approximates only the first term. When we include an approximation to the second term we obtain a first-order approximation to the posterior variance itself. In many examples, this elementary method, incorporating approximations to both terms, will substantially account for the estimation of {$\lambda$}. We briefly consider second-order approximations, noting that the work of Deely and Lindley (1981) may be extended using expansions derived by Lindley (1980), Mosteller and Wallace (1964), Tierney and Kadane (1986), and Tierney, Kass, and Kadane (1989). We suggest that second-order approximations provide rough and, often, easily computed assessments of accuracy of first-order approximations. Although we confine our data-analytical examples to simple models, we believe the methods will be useful in general settings. An important area of application is longitudinal data analysis.},

The choice of a theoretical distribution is also difficult when model-expected frequencies are 0 or when model probabilities are estimated 0 or 1. The authors propose to solve these problems by estimating the distribution of a fit measure, using bootstrap methods. An algorithm is presented for estimating this distribution by drawing bootstrap samples from the model-expected proportions, the so-called nonnaive bootstrap method. For the first time the method is applied to empirical data of varying sparseness, from five different data sets. Results show that the asymptotic chi-square distribution is not at all valid for sparse data.},

  abstract = {Ecological systems can often be characterised by changes among a finite set of underlying states pertaining to individuals, populations, communities or entire ecosystems through time. Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or `hidden'. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models (HMMs) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, HMMs have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to HMMs, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of HMMs for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise HMMs for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish HMMs as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.},

Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications.

The likelihood function and likelihood ratios have clear intuitive meanings that make it easy for students to grasp the important concepts. Modern computing technology has made it possible to use these methods over a wide range of practical applications. However, many mathematical statistics textbooks, particularly those at the Senior/Masters level, do not give this important topic coverage commensurate with its place in the world of modern applications. Similarly, in nonlinear estimation problems, standard practice (as reflected by procedures available in the popular commercial statistical packages) has been slow to recognize the advantages of likelihood-based confidence regions/intervals over the commonly use ``normal-theory'' regions/intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of the ``Wald statistic.'' In this note we outline our approach for presenting, to students, confidence regions/intervals based on ML estimation.},

Pearson correlation coefficients showed that the Mini-TQ was positively correlated with pulse (r\,=\,0.19; p\,{$<$}\,0.05) as well as with spin (r\,=\,0.12; p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Multilevel models revealed the following results: increases in tinnitus loudness were more strongly associated with increases in tinnitus distress at higher levels of pulse as well as at higher levels of spin (both p\,{$<$}\,0.05), whereby increases in tinnitus loudness correlated even stronger with increases in tinnitus distress when both pulse as well as spin were high (p\,{$<$}\,0.05).

The present study used data from the mobile application ``TrackYourTinnitus'' to explore whether tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress fluctuate within a 24-h interval. Multilevel models were performed to account for the nested structure of assessments (level 1: 17,209 daily life assessments) nested within days (level 2: 3,570 days with at least three completed assessments), and days nested within participants (level 3: 350 participants). Results revealed a time-of-day-dependence of tinnitus. In particular, tinnitus was perceived as louder and more distressing during the night and early morning hours (from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m.) than during the upcoming day. Since previous studies suggested that stress (and stress-associated hormones) show a circadian rhythm and this might influence the time-of-day-dependence of tinnitus, we evaluated whether the described results change when statistically controlling for subjectively reported stress-levels. Correcting for subjective stress-levels, however, did not change the result that tinnitus (loudness and distress) was most severe at night and early morning. These results show that time-of-day contributes to the level of both tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. Possible implications of our results for the clinical management of tinnitus are that tailoring the timing of therapeutic interventions to the circadian rhythm of individual patients (chronotherapy) might be promising.},

Available treatments are only effective in patient subgroups, i.e., medical doctors and patients have to figure out which therapy might be helpful in the patient's situation. Sufficiently large and qualitative longitudinal data sets, however, would be desirable to facilitate evidence-based treatment decisions for individual patients. On one hand, traditional sensing techniques (i.e., clinical trials) have many merits enabling evidence-based medicine. On the other, they have inherent limitations. First, clinical trials are very cost- and labour-intensive. Second, the traditional approach aims at reducing ecological heterogeneity to enable the investigation of homogeneous subsamples. Recently, a new paradigm emerged that offers promising perspectives for collecting large amounts of longitudinal patient data \textendash{} Mobile Crowd Sensing. By utilizing smart mobile devices of a large number of patients, health information can be gathered from large patient collections as well as at many different time points and in various real life environmental situations. In the Track Your Tinnitus project, we implemented such a mobile crowd sensing platform to reveal new medical aspects about tinnitus with a particular focus on the variability of tinnitus over time depending on the environmental situation. In this paper, the current project status as well as first lessons learned from running the mobile application for twelve months are presented.

Sufficiently large and qualitative longitudinal data sets, which aggregate the individuals' demographic and clinical characteristics, together with their response to specific therapeutic interventions, would therefore facilitate evidence-based treatment suggestions for individual patients. Currently, clinical trials are the standard instrument for realizing evidence-based medicine. However, the related information gathering is limited. For example, clinical trials try to reduce the complexity of the individual case by generating homogeneous groups to obtain significant results. From the latter, individual treatment decisions are inferred. A complementary approach would be to assess the effect of specific interventions in large samples considering the individual peculiarity of each subject. This allows providing individualized treatment decisions. Recently, mobile crowd sensing emerged as an approach for collecting large and ecological valid datasets at rather low costs. By providing mobile crowd sensing services to large numbers of patients, large datasets can be gathered cheaply on a daily basis. In the TrackYourTinnitus project, we implemented a mobile crowd sensing platform to reveal new medical aspects on tinnitus and its treatment. Additionally, we work on mobile services exploring approaches for understanding tinnitus and for improving its diagnostic and therapeutic management. We present the TrackYourTinnitus platform as well as its goals, architecture and preliminary results.

  abstract = {We have developed a generalization of Kimura's Markov chain model for base substitution at a single nucleotide site. This generalized model incorporates more flexible transition rates and consequently allows irreversible as well as reversible chains. Because the model embodies just the right amount of symmetry, it permits explicit calculation of finite-time transition probabilities and equilibrium distributions. The model also meshes well with maximum likelihood methods for phylogenetic analysis. Quick calculation of likelihoods and their derivatives can be carried out by adapting Baum's forward and backward algorithms from the theory of hidden Markov chains. Analysis of HIV sequence data illustrates the speed of the algorithms on trees with many contemporary taxa. Analysis of some of Lake's data on the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus contrasts the reversible and irreversible versions of the model.},

  abstract = {Ever since the introduction of hidden Markov models by Baum and his co-workers, the method of choice for fitting such models has been maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. In recent years it has been noticed that the gradient and Hessian of the log likelihood of hidden Markov and related models may be calculated in parallel with a filtering process by which the likelihood may be calculated. Various authors have used, or suggested the use of, this idea in order to maximize the likelihood directly, without using the EM algorithm. In this paper we discuss an implementation of such an approach. We have found that a straightforward implementation of Newton's method sometimes works but is unreliable. A form of the Levenberg\textendash Marquardt algorithm appears to provide excellent reliability. Two rather complex examples are given for applying this algorithm to the fitting of hidden Markov models. In the first a better than 6-fold increase in speed over the EM algorithm was achieved. The second example turned out to be problematic (somewhat interestingly) in that the maximum likelihood estimator appears to be inconsistent. Whatever its merit, this estimator is calculated much faster by Levenberg\textendash Marquardt than by EM. We also compared the Levenberg\textendash Marquardt algorithm, applied to the first example, with a generic numerical maximization procedure. The Levenberg\textendash Marquardt algorithm appeared to perform almost three times better than the generic procedure, even when analytic derivatives were provided, and 19 times better when they were not provided.},

A similar construction of a confidence interval for a single entry of a vector can be implemented by repeatedly maximising over the other parameters. We present an algorithm for finding these confidence interval endpoints that requires less computation. It employs a modified Newton-Raphson iteration to solve a system of equations that defines the endpoints.},
